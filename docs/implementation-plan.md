# Implementation Plan for Docker-Ripper Notification System

## Directory Structure

Create the following directory structure in the project:

```
root/
├── ripper/
│   └── ripper.sh (existing file to be modified)
└── notifications/
    ├── notifications.sh (main notification module)
    ├── providers/
    │   ├── discord.sh
    │   ├── pushover.sh
    │   └── webhook.sh
    └── README.md (documentation)
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create the Core Notification Module

#### File: `notifications/notifications.sh`

This will be the main entry point for the notification system. It will:
- Load provider modules
- Initialize the notification system based on environment variables
- Provide functions for sending notifications
- Handle provider selection and message routing

### 2. Create Provider Modules

#### File: `notifications/providers/discord.sh`

Implement Discord webhook notifications with:
- Configuration validation
- Rich embed formatting
- Error handling and logging

#### File: `notifications/providers/pushover.sh`

Implement Pushover API notifications with:
- Configuration validation
- Priority mapping
- Device and sound selection
- Error handling and logging

#### File: `notifications/providers/webhook.sh`

Implement generic webhook notifications with:
- Support for different HTTP methods
- Custom headers
- Flexible payload formatting
- Error handling and logging

### 3. Modify Existing Scripts

#### File: `ripper/ripper.sh`

Add notification calls at key points:

1. **Disc Detection**
```bash
# After disc type is detected
notify_info "Disc Detected" "Detected $DISC_TYPE disc: $DISC_LABEL"
```

2. **Rip Start**
```bash
# Before starting rip process
notify_info "Rip Started" "Starting to rip $DISC_TYPE disc: $DISC_LABEL"
```

3. **Rip Completion**
```bash
# After successful rip
notify_info "Rip Completed" "Successfully ripped $DISC_TYPE disc: $DISC_LABEL to $OUTPUT_PATH"
```

4. **Error Events**
```bash
# On error
notify_error "Rip Error" "Error ripping $DISC_TYPE disc: $ERROR_MESSAGE"
```

### 4. Update Documentation

#### File: `notifications/README.md`

Create documentation explaining:
- How to enable and configure the notification system
- Available environment variables
- Examples for each provider
- Troubleshooting tips

#### File: `README.md` (main project README)

Add a section about the notification system with:
- Brief overview
- Link to detailed documentation
- Basic usage example

### 5. Update Dockerfile and Docker Compose

#### File: `latest/Dockerfile` and others

Add comments about the notification environment variables.

#### File: `docker-compose.yml`

Add example environment variables (commented out) for notifications.

## Testing Plan

Test the notification system with:

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test each provider independently
   - Verify error handling with invalid configurations
   - Check message formatting

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Full cycle tests with actual discs
   - Test with different disc types
   - Verify notifications are sent at the correct times

3. **Configuration Testing**
   - Test with different environment variable combinations
   - Verify provider selection logic works correctly
